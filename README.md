# Advent of Code 2020

Javascript (ECMAscript6) code for the [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020/).

No packages needed

## Day 1

quite brute force, no duplicate numbers adding
 
 
## Day 2

finding letters in strings

## Day 3

only keeping the trees and their position in the map

if the Toboggan goes past the original map, it gets off set by the map width, no need for duplicating the map

## Day 4

data validation, using strings as keys to check which fields need checking, each field has a validation function.

## Day 5

Binary search and finding neighbours

## Day 6

Finding answer counts, use of sets to remove duplicates
